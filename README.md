# KidCyber Log Detective 👀🔎  
A mini cyber adventure for kids ages **6–12** (and fun for grown-ups too!)

Your child becomes a **CyberHero Log Detective** — reading tiny log “clues,” spotting strange behavior, and deciding:  
**Is this suspicious or normal?**

This activity is fast, friendly, and perfect for classrooms, after-school groups, libraries, or at home.

---

# 🚀 Two Ways to Play

This project now includes **two versions**:

## 1️⃣ CLI Version (Terminal Game)
A simple yes/no game you run on your computer.

- Shows **one log at a time**
- Uses **kid-friendly EST timestamps**
- Players answer:  
  **“Is this suspicious? (yes/no)”**

### How to run (Mac/Windows):
```bash
cd cli_version
python3 detective.py

<pre>
kidcyber-log-detective-main/
    cli_version/
         detective.py
    html_version/
         index.html
         logs/
            sample_logs.jsonl
<pre>
